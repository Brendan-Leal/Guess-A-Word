# Guess a Word

This app was made during Launch Schools Core Curriculum. We were supplied CSS and tasked to implement the HTML and JavaScript of a hangman esque game. The user press a key on the keyboard to guess a letter and we use JavaScript to listen for that event, validate a letter was pressed, and determine if the letter is part of the word or not. We learned about handlebars the template language to build more dynamic HTML.
